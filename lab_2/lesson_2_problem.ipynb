This time, the solution returned by your algorithm will be the preferred action to accomplish in a given state, not a full policy. You can perform some preliminary tests on the previous environment and then test your algorithm on the new environment explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "The **Upper Confidence Trees (UCT)** algorithm is a sampling-based method that balances *exploration* and *exploitation* when searching through state-action spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/uct_lookahead.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The main **UCT_Lookahead Function** iteratively invokes rollouts until the termination condition is met. After the process, it determines the best action based on the Q-values. \n",
    "This implementation applies UCT with a recursive rollout process to evaluate and select the best action in a given state based on accumulated Q-values and visit counts. It operates under a depth-limited search and terminates based on the number of simulations performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rollout.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive **UCT Rollout Function** selects actions based on the exploration-exploitation tradeoff to simulate transitions to new states and uses the accumulated cost to update the Q-values for each state-action pair.\n",
    "The action selection strategy is implemented using a UCT-based formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/select-UCT-max.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - Q(s, a): Action value for state-action pair (s, a);\n",
    "   - N(s): Total visit count for state s;\n",
    "   - N(s, a): Visit count for state-action pair (s, a);\n",
    "   - C: Exploration-exploitation tradeoff constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MDP_Lookahead** function repeatedly calls the UCT_Lookahead to select the next action and execute the selected action (using the step() method) until a goal state is reached:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/mdp_lookahead.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "   \n",
    "Finally, we will need some **helper Functions** that depend on the environment to which we apply the UCT algorithm:\n",
    "   - `V0`: Provides a heuristic value for terminal states.\n",
    "   - `Sample`: Simulates a transition to a new state given a state-action pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the difference between the step() method and the Sample() method: the step method executes the action in the world where the agent is operating while the Sample() method simulates the execution of the action to select the next best action through the UCT Rollout process. In this exercise, we use a copy of the environments where the agent operates to simulate the execution, hence the UCT rollout will be very accurate and the process very efficient. In real-life scenarios, we typically do not have such an accurate simulator/model of the environment."
